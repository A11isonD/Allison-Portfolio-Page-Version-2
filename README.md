# Allison-Portfolio-Page-Version-2
This project consists of my portfolio website as a way to demonstrate the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills I learned in Part 1 of Code Louisville's Web Development course.  The intended purpose is for networking and the targeted audience is potential employers.  I will also use it as a platform to display future projects as I gain more proficiency in coding.  

I included two media queries.  My project contains three CSS and JavaScript features from the required list:  
    1. A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes.  
    2. *Flexbox or CSS Grid (one or maybe both)* to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views.
    3. JavaScript 'Contact Me' form
